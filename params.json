{"google":"","body":"### What Is Maacro?\r\nMaacro is a .Net application to facilitate hands-free operation of remote ops in the popular facebook game Marvel Avenger's Alliance. Remote Ops allow you the player to gain bits of XP and silver by repeatedly sending up to 8 heroes on deployment missions for designated periods of time. Maacro facilitates this by taking your mouse locations for the various UI elements and syncing them together into a macro which is played on a loop while you sleep or work.\r\n\r\n### How Do I Use Maacro?\r\nWhen you open Maacro there are three buttons horizontally: Configure, Build, and Record. First, click Configure. Select each UI element in the listbox, move your mouse to the corresponding location on your game screen, and press F2 to assign that position. Do this for all of the screen elements.\r\n\r\nThen click the Build button. This is where you enter the total number of hero pages you have on the Deploy screen as well as enter the page and slot number of individual heroes you wish to deploy. The page and slot number are relative to whatever was selected before it. So let's say you want to deploy Scarlet Witch and then Hulk, with SW on Page 1 Slot 3 and Hulk on Page 1 Slot 5. You'd enter Page 1 Slot 3 as the initial deployment, then enter Page 1 Slot 4 for Hulk, because after selecting SW Hulk will have shifted left a slot from slot 5 to slot 4. Note that this is generally the case but I have seen it where other non-selected heroes swap positions or the shift is not as expected. The easiest way is to just do the deployment you want manually, taking note and applying each Page/Slot number into Maacro while you do it.\r\n\r\nWhen your desired deployment is set, click Record. Select the time between clicking UI elements, then click Play. The clicking and waiting will happen as deployments are repeated infinitely in a loop until you press the Escape key.\r\n\r\n### How do I wrote codes?\r\nThe repository is currently private but if any enterprising goons wish to contribute, let me know here on github or SA or the facebook group.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@ray2k\r\n\r\n","name":"Maacro","note":"Don't delete this file!
